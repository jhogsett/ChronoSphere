# ChronoSphere Hardware Test Suite

This hardware test suite provides comprehensive testing of each individual hardware component of the Weather Clock project. It allows you to verify each sensor and device one-at-a-time before integrating them all together.

## Quick Start

### Building the Test Suite
```bash
# Build for Arduino Nano Every (recommended)
pio run -e test_nano_every

# Build for Arduino Nano ATmega328 (compatibility)
pio run -e test_nanoatmega328

# Upload to connected Arduino
pio run -e test_nano_every -t upload

# Monitor serial output
pio device monitor
```

### Running Tests
1. Connect your Arduino via USB
2. Upload the test firmware
3. Open serial monitor (115200 baud)
4. Use the interactive menu to test each component

## Complete Usage Instructions

### Step-by-Step Hardware Testing Process

#### Phase 1: Setup and Preparation
1. **Hardware Connection**
   - Connect Arduino Nano Every via USB cable
   - Wire all components according to pin definitions in `Config.h`

2. **Software Preparation**
   ```bash
   # Navigate to project directory
   cd c:\DEV\ChronoSphere
   
   # Build the hardware test suite
   pio run -e test_nano_every
   
   # Upload to Arduino (ensure correct COM port)
   pio run -e test_nano_every -t upload
   
   # Open serial monitor

- Check power consumption doesn't cause brownouts

#### Phase 4: Validation and Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

**üö® Display Issues**
```
Symptoms: "Display initialization failed"
Solutions:
- Check I2C wiring (SDA to A4, SCL to A5 on Nano)
- Verify I2C addresses: 0x70, 0x71, 0x72
- Ensure 5V power to displays
- Test I2C scanner code if needed
```

**üö® Sensor Reading Errors**
```
Symptoms: "Failed to read sensor" messages
Solutions:
- Allow sensors 2-3 minutes to stabilize after power-on
- Check individual I2C addresses don't conflict
- Verify sensor power requirements (3.3V vs 5V)
- Test with simpler I2C scanner first
```

**üö® Encoder Not Responding**
```
Symptoms: No rotation or button detection
Solutions:
- Verify pin connections (CLK=2, DT=3, SW=4)
- Check for loose wiring
- May need external 10kŒ© pull-up resistors
- Test mechanical encoder by hand rotation
```

**üö® LED Strip Not Working**
```
Symptoms: No LEDs lighting or wrong colors
Solutions:
- Check data pin connection (Pin 13)
- Verify adequate power supply for LEDs
- Test with reduced brightness first
- Ensure common ground between Arduino and LED strip
```

  testData.temperatureF = 85.0; // Test hot temperature
}

void testLEDStrip() {
  // Add custom LED patterns here
  testLightingEffects.setSolidColor(255, 255, 0); // Yellow
}
```

**Building for Different Targets:**
```bash
# For Arduino Nano ATmega328 (memory constrained)
pio run -e test_nanoatmega328
pio run -e test_nanoatmega328 -t upload

# For main application (after testing complete)
pio run -e nano_every
pio run -e nano_every -t upload
```

### Integration with Main Application

**After Successful Hardware Testing:**
1. Document which tests passed/failed
2. Note any hardware quirks or timing issues
3. Update main application if needed for discovered issues
4. Switch back to main firmware for full system testing

**Switching Between Test and Main Firmware:**
```bash
# Upload test suite
pio run -e test_nano_every -t upload

# Upload main weather clock application
pio run -e nano_every -t upload

# Monitor either firmware
pio device monitor
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Display Not Working**
- Check I2C connections (SDA/SCL)
- Verify I2C addresses (0x70, 0x71, 0x72)
- Ensure 5V power supply
- **Brightness Matching**: Different colored LEDs have different brightness levels at the same setting. The code automatically compensates (Green=1, Amber=9, Red=15) to achieve uniform apparent brightness

**Sensor Reading Errors**
- Check I2C wiring
- Verify sensor power (3.3V or 5V as required)
- Allow sensors to stabilize (temperature sensors need ~2-3 minutes)

**Encoder Not Responding**
- Verify pin connections (CLK=2, DT=3, SW=4)
- Check pull-up resistors (may need external 10kŒ©)
- Test mechanical encoder rotation

**LED Strip Not Lighting**
- Check data pin connection (Pin 13)
- Verify power supply (LEDs need adequate current)
- Test with lower brightness first

### Memory Usage
- **Arduino Nano Every**: 17.6% RAM, 69.2% Flash - ‚úÖ Good headroom
- **Arduino Nano ATmega328**: May require reduced feature set
