## Hardware Foundation Work

- Implement test functions for each sensor/device to verify data reading
    - Each device should be tested one-at-a-time before proceeding to the next device
- The devices are: 
    - Display
        - Ensure the three individual display devices can be written to
    - Rotary Encoder
        - Ensure the encoder turning and pushbutton data can be read
    - Audio Module
        - Ensure MIDI sounds can be played from the device
    - Real Time Clock
        - Ensure the time and date data can be set (to some fixed value, no UI yet)
        - Ensure the time and data data can be read
    - Temperature and Humidity Sensor
        - Ensure the temperature data can be read
        - Ensure the humidity data can be read
    - Light Sensor
        - Ensure the light data can be read
    - Pressure Sensor
        - Ensure the pressure data can be read
    - LED Strip
        - Ensure the LED Strip can be written to
- Ensure that the data from each sensor can be printed to the console for verification
